# Kotlin Math Project

This is a project focused on math and maybe eventually machine learning

This is a no-license project.

And to explain the wierd math terms, I'm Norwegian and have learned math in Norwegian, but not in English, so **NO** part of this is meant to confuse people, if you know the English words for the math terms please bully me, and I'll get it fixed.
