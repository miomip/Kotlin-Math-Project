# Kotlin Math Project

This is a project focused on math and maybe eventually AI and machine learning

This is a no-license project.

And to explain the wierd math terms, I'm Norwegian and have learned math and the ways we say certain terms in Norwegian, but not in English, so **NO** part of this is meant to confuse people, if you know the English words for the math terms please comment, and I'll get it fixed.

Happy coding -miomip
